                <li><strong>Starting Position:</strong> Begin in a modified push-up position with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart for balance.
                Place one hand on the ground directly under your shoulder, fingers pointing forward.
                Tuck your other arm behind your back or keep it at your side.

                <li><strong>Lowering Phase:</strong> Slowly bend your supporting arm, lowering your chest toward the ground.
                Keep your body straight and avoid twisting or tilting.
                Lower as far as your strength allows while maintaining control.</li>
                <li><strong>Pushing Phase:</strong> Push through your palm to straighten your arm and return to the starting position.
                Maintain stability and balance throughout the movement.</li>

            <strong>How to Perform Box Jumps:</strong>
            <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 10px; padding:0px;font-size:14px;">
                <li><strong>Set Up:</strong> Stand in front of a sturdy box or platform, with your feet about shoulder-width apart.
                Engage your core and keep your chest lifted.
                Place the box at a height appropriate for your fitness level (start low if you're a beginner).</li>
                <li><strong>Preparatory Phase:</strong> Bend your knees slightly and push your hips back into a quarter-squat position.
                Swing your arms backward to generate momentum.
                Engage your core to maintain a neutral spine.</li>
                <li><strong>Jump Phase:</strong> Explosively push through your heels and extend your legs, swinging your arms forward as you jump.
                Aim to land softly on the box with both feet, ensuring your knees are slightly bent to absorb the impact.</li>
                <li><strong>Landing Phase:</strong> Land with your feet flat and knees tracking over your toes, not caving inward.
                Stand up fully on the box to complete the movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Dismount:</strong> Step down one foot at a time (safer for joints), or jump off carefully if you're experienced and confident in your landing technique.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Perform the desired number of repetitions or for a set time.</li>

                <li><strong>High Knee Motion:</strong> Begin by running in place or moving forward, lifting one knee at a time toward your chest as high as you can.
                Alternate legs rapidly, keeping your movements controlled.
                Pump your arms in sync with your legs, with your opposite arm moving forward with each lifted knee.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Speed and Form:</strong>Land lightly on the balls of your feet.
                Maintain a fast pace while keeping your upper body stable.
